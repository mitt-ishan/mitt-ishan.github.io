            <p class="mb-2"><strong>Grade:</strong> First Class Honours (1:1)</p>

            <p class="mb-2">
              A comprehensive program focused on data science and engineering techniques including ML, DL, NLP, and large-scale analytics. Included practical thesis research, industry projects, and academic coursework.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-2"><strong>Relevant Modules:</strong> Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Tools & Techniques for Large-Scale Data Analytics, Programming for Data Analytics, Statistics for Data Science, Data Visualisation</p>

            <p class="mb-2"><strong>Thesis:</strong> <em>Enhancing Financial Derivative Valuation – A Deep Learning Approach to Option Pricing</em><br>
              Developed a hybrid LSTM-ARIMA model to improve the accuracy of financial derivative pricing, specifically focusing on option pricing.
Benchmarked the model against traditional approaches like the Black-Scholes model and advanced deep learning architectures (MLP, LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, CNN-LSTM).
Achieved superior performance by reducing error metrics (MSE, RMSE) and demonstrated increased robustness for complex and volatile financial markets.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-2"><strong>Academic Projects:</strong></p>
            <ul class="mb-3">
              <li><strong>Fake News Detection using a Heuristic-Driven Ensemble Framework:</strong> Built an automated system to classify tweets as “real” or “fake” using pre-trained models (BERT, RoBERTa) and a heuristic algorithm analyzing usernames and link domains. Improved accuracy via preprocessing, tokenization, model optimization, and heuristic post-processing. Delivered project presentation to faculty.</li>
  
              <li><strong>Road Surface Classification using Images:</strong> Developed a CNN-based classifier to categorize road surfaces (asphalt, concrete, gravel) using Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) and EfficientNet architectures. Enhanced model accuracy through literature-informed improvements and produced a detailed report.</li>
  
              <li><strong>Sentiment Analysis and Span Extraction for Tweets:</strong> Created an NLP pipeline to classify tweets into sentiment categories and extract sentiment spans using word frequency ratios and sentiment-specific weights. Improved model performance through advanced preprocessing, including lemmatization, stopword removal, and handling null values.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>IdeasLab Enterprise Challenge – Aerogen:</strong><br>
              Collaborated on a real-world business challenge to improve intern retention at Aerogen. Participated in six workshops covering problem analysis, design thinking, team building, and presentation skills. Led the team in identifying challenges, designing a functional prototype, and delivering a final presentation, earning a Certificate of Achievement from the University of Galway.
