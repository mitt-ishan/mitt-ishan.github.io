              I am a Data Engineer with over 5 years of experience designing and delivering robust data solutions across the retail, healthcare, and finance sectors. Starting my career at Wipro, I built a strong foundation in large-scale ETL development, data modeling, and cloud migration projects. Over the years, I have developed expertise in Talend, PySpark, Databricks, Snowflake and AWS—creating solutions that enable business insights and operational efficiency.
              <br><br>
              My work spans automating data ingestion, integrating real-time streaming, and building scalable, cloud-native architectures to support analytics, machine learning, and decision-making at scale. I thrive on solving complex problems, optimizing performance, and ensuring data reliability for analytics teams and stakeholders.
              <br><br>
              I hold a Master’s in Data Analytics from the University of Galway, graduating with First Class Honours (1:1). My coursework covered advanced topics in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and NLP, supported by academic projects in text analytics, image classification, and predictive modeling. My thesis, <em>Enhancing Financial Derivative Valuation – A Deep Learning Approach to Option Pricing</em>, introduced a hybrid LSTM-ARIMA model that outperformed traditional and advanced deep learning methods in volatile markets.
              <br><br>
              Currently, I am a Data Engineer II at Mastercard, working with the Hadoop ecosystem (Hadoop, Hive, Impala), Databricks, and PySpark to design scalable, secure, and high-performance data pipelines. I combine technical expertise with strong problem-solving, communication, and leadership skills, and I am passionate about integrating automation, advanced analytics, and modern data engineering practices to transform raw data into actionable intelligence.
